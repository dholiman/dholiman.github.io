Recognizing the critical role of user-friendly interfaces in the direct sales industry, we sought to minimize confusion, facilitating successful purchases and fostering customer conversion and retention.</p>

                            <p>With a catalogue boasting over 1,400 SKUs, facilitating product discovery emerged as a pivotal process to optimize. Data analysis revealed that both search and header navigation methods were ineffective, leading potential customers to feel overwhelmed and abandon the platform.</p>

                            <h3>Solving the Right Problem the Wrong Way</h3>
                            <p>The journey commenced with a careful examination of the shopping flow, identifying poorly optimized primary navigation methods as a key obstacle. The cluttered main header navigation and product search feature were the major culprits. In our tests, finding products took an excessive amount of time due to overlapping categories within one mega-menu. Simplifying options and improving navigation was vital, but a category review was not approved. </p>

                            <p>Through iterative cycles of wireframing, mockups, and user testing, we unveiled a prototype that expedited product discovery by an average of 17 seconds. Collaborating with the Brand team, we integrated updated branding elements, including carefully curated photos for each header link. A subsequent A/B/C test revealed promising outcomes for our new navigation. As we approached the end of the month, the test experienced an unexpected anomaly.</p>
                            <p>Our direct selling members began placing their monthly commission-earning orders. The visual changes caused confusion for members who had already grown accustomed to our old navigation system, outweighing the potential benefits. Prioritizing member experience over marginal revenue gains, we reverted to the original navigation system.</p>

                            <h3>The Other Side of the Coin</h3>
                            <p>After this disappointing test, our stakeholders moved on. One researcher and I could not abandon our newly gained knowledge, and continued analyzing user navigation methods. We refocused our attention on the search feature, which seemed to have been untouched since launch. With updated the visual styles, we attracted more attention to the feature. We also changed the behavior during scroll to enlarge the search bar while also minimizing the sticky header. Lastly, we reduced the number of clicks needed to interact with the feature.</p>
                            <p>While Iâ€™m the first to admit that much of this process was based on intuition and speculation, our testing validated our hypotheses. During a 1 month test, we saw a significant increase in conversion rate for those placing one-time orders.</p>
