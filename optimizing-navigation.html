                            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                            <p>With over 1,400 SKUs, helping users find the products they’re looking for is one of the most valuable processes to optimize. As we hypothesized, our data showed two dominant methods of product discovery: search and header navigation. Both methods were poorly optimized and led to potential customers feeling overwhelmed and in-turn, dropping from the shopping platform.</p>

                            <h3>The Goals</h3>
                            <p>Like many companies with a product focus, our key objective is to boost conversion rates and revenue. Achieving this goal involves streamlining the shopping experience. We know reducing confusion is pivotal for successful purchases. Especially in the direct sales industry, a user-friendly UI with an intuitive workflow significantly aids in converting potential members and retaining the existing ones.</p>

                            <h3>The Process</h3>
                            <p>Our journey began with a close examination of our shopping flow, revealing poorly optimized primary navigation methods that overwhelmed potential customers, causing them to drop from the platform. The cluttered main header navigation and product search feature were the major culprits. In our tests, finding categories took an excessive amount of time due to overlapping categories within one mega-menu. Simplifying options and improving navigation was vital. Though a category review wasn't approved, we designed a simplified navigation using alternative methods.</p>

                            <p>After extensive iterations involving wireframes, mockups, research, and a bit of speculation, we presented our first prototype for a pilot user test. The results were encouraging, with users finding products an average of 17 seconds faster. This led us to collaborate with the Brand team to integrate updated branding through carefully selected photos for every link in the header nav. A subsequent A/B/C test revealed variants B (redesigned layout with supporting photos) and C (redesigned layout with additional white space) to be effective. However, as we approached the end of the month, the test experienced an unexpected anomaly. Our direct selling members began placing their monthly commission-earning orders. The visual changes caused confusion for members who had already grown accustomed to our old navigation system, outweighing the potential gains. In agreement with the stakeholders, we opted to preserve the member experience over marginal revenue increases.</p>

                            <p>After this disappointing test, a few of us continued analyzing user navigation methods. We refocused our attention on the search feature, which seemed to have been untouched since launch. With updated the visual styles, we attracted more attention to the feature. We also changed the behavior during scroll to enlarge the search bar while also minimizing the sticky header. Lastly, we reduced the number of clicks needed to interact with the feature.</p>
                            <p>While I’m the first to admit that much of this process was based on speculation, our testing validated our hypotheses. During a 1 month test, we saw a significant increase in conversion rate for those placing one-time orders.</p>
