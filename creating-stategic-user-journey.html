                            <h3>Overcoming Agency Prejudice</h3>
                            <p>Multiman Services had worked with several different marketing agencies in the past and were naturally skeptical of online marketing as a result. They were assured several things by previous marketing companies who failed to deliver on their promises. Naturally, the owner expected a return on the money he spent on his advertising and wanted a way to track results.</p>

                        <div class="cs-content">
                            <p class="label-sm">The Goal:</p>
                            <h3>Attract, Educate, and Convert</h3>
                            <p>As an SEO agency, we were hired to optimize the digital presence of Multiman Services. As we developed a strategy, we decided to aim for 3 checkpoints that aligned with our main goal of increased profitability. First was to address the elephant in the room, a non-existent digital pressence. Second, we needed to attract customers to the new outlets. Third, we wanted to use education to help convert potential customers.</p>

                            <p class="label-sm">The Process:</p>
                            <h3>Working Backwards to Solve Unusual Problems</h3>
                            <p>We started off the process with the business owner. We needed to align our strategy with his and earn the trust required to move forward with our strategy.</p>
                            <P>After alignment, we began working towards our goals in reverse. I designed the site with easy conversion at the forefront of my mind. I then used video, photos, and testimonials to build trust with users and educate them on the value of service. Because video was our primary content type, this created a slight obstacle for incorporating SEO. In collaboration with the SEO team, we found a few simple solutions required to attract new customers.</P>
                            <P>After the website and SEO were finished, we connected all social accounts, including Google Business, to the new site. This created a single digital presence that supported our main goal of increasing profitability.</p>

I dive deep into problem-solving, leverage user research for impactful changes, and streamline workflows. While my knack for adaptability ensures I stay on the pulse of design systems and trends, my mission will always be to use design to advocate for the people using my product.</p>
                                <p>When not head down in a high-fidelity prototype, you’ll find me drinking copious amounts of coffee, admiring the work of my favorite artists, and tinkering with things I have no business tinkering with.</p>
                                <p>And yes, bad leading does keep me up at night.</p>
