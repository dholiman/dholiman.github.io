                        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                        <p>With over 1,400 SKUs, helping users find the products they’re looking for is one of the most valuable processes to optimize. As we hypothesized, our data showed two dominant methods of product discovery: search and header navigation. Both methods were poorly optimized and led to potential customers feeling overwhelmed and in-turn, dropping from the shopping platform.</p>

                        <h3>The Goals</h3>
                        <p>As with most product focused companies, one main objective in to increase conversion. There are a few ways to work towards this goal. First, we see that decreased confusion leads to an increase in purchase success. Next, and especially within the direct sales industry, we see that a pleasant UI with an intuitive workflow will help convert potential members and retain existing members.</p>

                        <h3>The Process</h3>
                        <p>As we began the process of analyzing our shopping flow, we quickly realized that both primary shopping methods were poorly optimized and led to potential customers feeling overwhelmed and in-turn, dropping from the shopping platform. 
                            <P>The search feature was pulling all products within parameters, but displaying them in order of last update on our back end. The solution for this issue was simple, re-organize the search results and default the results to closest match. In addition, we added Sort By, Brand, Price, and other filters to help users dial their results down to a manageable amount.</P>
                            <P>The header navigation was a different story. In our tests, some categories could take up to 2-3 minutes to find with some outliers reaching nearly 5 minutes! This navigation was 1 mega-menu with 49 overlapping categories listed, creating major choice paralysis. The real solution would have been dialing back and simplifying the options listed. Although a category restructure was not approved, we simplified the navigation in other ways.</p>
                            <P>After countless wireframes, mockups, research, and a little speculation, we submitted our first prototype for a pilot user test. The results looked promising and led to users finding their products an average of 17 seconds faster. At this point, we synced with the Brand team to help push a branding change through the use of photos. We selected 3 photos for every link in the header nav, and ran a card sorting test to let the customers tell us what fit each category the best. Because we had some close ties in the last test, we built the component and released it as part of an A/B/C test: Original Navigation, Revised with 1st place photos, Revised with 2nd place photos.</p>
